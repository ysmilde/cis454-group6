Group 6 CIS454 project

several coding standards our team need to follow in the future (Ver. 1)

1. use camel name standard ("front page" may name as "FrontPage")
2. if possible, comment in files you build with author name (format would be: //author name: Shukai)
3. create files into folders that they belong to (php files into php folder, js files into javascript folder)
4. codes may need to be readable and variables may create with specific meaning (do not use "a","ss" as variable name) 
5. about aesthetics, background images and UI interface need to be improved: more suitable images and better design ideas are encouraged to upload after get everyone's approval in team chat:)

new:
6. download a web server, such as wampserver in windows, XAMPP in mac, enter in localhost/phpmyadmin
username is root and no password to check database information
7. index1.php is the mainpage for customer, add front end work on that page (several pics have already been added there)
this file may be updated later
